# ðŸ˜„ About me

I am a fan of programming in general, since I was a child I have always been interested in creating video games and modifications of existing games, I am currently very interested in both game development and Web development, mainly the Backend.
I'm currently working on my Android game TuCofradia and on small projects that come up.
